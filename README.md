In this assignment, I have developed a program that allows users to input a specific path. The program then scans all text files within the given path and identifies the common words among them. By employing a professional approach, the program efficiently handles this task.

Upon receiving the user's input path, the program utilizes a robust algorithm to traverse through the designated directory. It specifically targets text files, denoted by the .txt extension, ensuring that only relevant files are processed.

Next, the program systematically analyzes the contents of each text file. Employing advanced natural language processing techniques, it tokenizes the text, separating it into individual words. It also performs various text preprocessing steps, such as removing punctuation and converting all words to lowercase, to ensure accurate results.

Using an optimized data structure, such as a hash table or a dictionary, the program maintains a count of each word encountered across all text files. This enables efficient tracking and comparison of word frequencies.

Once all the text files have been processed, the program identifies the common words by determining which words have the highest frequency across the entire corpus. These common words are then presented to the user in a clear and organized manner.
